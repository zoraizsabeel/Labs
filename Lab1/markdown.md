# High Level Approach
   - create two forloops the go through the array until the sum is found, then return the two indexes
   - ForLoop 1:
       - selects a index
       - Forloop 2 goes through array undtil sum is found, if not first for-loop iterates and so on, if sum  == arr[i]+arr[j] then return array containing both indexes
