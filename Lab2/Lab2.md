# High level Approach
    - remove all factors that might affect the comparison, such as numbers or spaces.
    - check if lengths are the same, and use loops to compare and check if all values exist as alphabets and remove spaces
# For Loop one:
    - set to a certain index = 0
# For Loop Two;
    - set to another index, now we can compare thorughout and see if values exist in both sentantaces as long as the lengths are the same
    - if the value exists you break the loop, if not you return false
    - return true once all is done within the loops else return false
